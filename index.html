      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello everyone, my name is David and I am an aspiring front end developer. 
        I believe that taking this course with U of M will allow me to acquire critical knowledge needed to succeed in the everchanging world of technology.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Charleston, SC. However, I have family all over the world. Both of my biological parents are Colombian, and 
        my step-father is half Brazilian. Even more so, my father married a women from Lithuania and currently I have a younger half-sibling who lives in Klaipeda, Lithuania.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My hobbies include running, learning languages, listening to music, and going to the beach. I thoroughly enjoy spending time outside, 
        and I hope to one day be able to merge the worlds of software development and nature. 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To put it simply, my dream job would be as a front-end developer who creates intricate, beautifully designed websites that speak to the user in a way that crosses cultural boundaries. I hope that my skills gained in 
        this course will allow me to one day work straight from my computer so that I can travel to globe to places that would continue to inspire my work.   </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I recently moved back to Charleston, SC after living in Miami for a little over a year. I truly loved Miami and I hope to make it back in the near future.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I believe that becoming a web developer will allow me to be a creative in a way that I previously have not been able to do with my previous work.
        I also feel that with this profession, the opportunities are endless and it is hard to say exactly where I will end up within the next 10-20 years. 
        However, I am hopeful that this career path will allow me to travel the globe to meet people from every facet of the Earth, and to experience a wide variety of different cultures.
